# TYPETR-Bitcount TODO

## TODO

* **Needs some working with Simon** Decide on final color pixel types (design and layers) to show COLRv1 functions 
* **Need input from Google** Decide on axis names for the main design space. 
* ** Petr doing** Merge the test VF design space with the main Bitcount design spaces and build new VF. 
* **Petr doing** Since the Bitcount-Bold has overlapping pixels (which is not visible in monochrome colors) needs to be sorted in the base masters in order to achieve a more consistent pattern inside letters. Now the order of the pixel components it random from copy/paste in the past. 
* **Petr doing** Rewrite the *build.py* using plain fontmake instead of the current FontProject. 
* **Petr doing** Generate all 6 standard VF (mono width black pixels only), including the COLRv1 axes.
	* Bitcount Grid Double
	* Bitcount Grid Single
	* Bitcount Mono Double
	* Bitcount Mono Single
	* Bitcount Prop Double
	* Bitcount Prop Single
* **Petr doing** Generate all instances font files in *otf/* and *ttf/*
* **DONE. Needs editorial input from Google?** Adapt the website to include COLRv1 examples.
* **Editorial checks from Google?** The “manual” document is in documentation/Bitcountreference.md which exports into documentation/BitcountReference.pdf. This document has a download link on the site.
* **Petr doing, once the VF is running** Add more example images for documentation to generate BitcountReference.pdf, also including the latest state for COLRv1 examples.
* **Petr doing, once the VF is running** Implement COLv1 VF examples with additional layers and axes.

*  **Petr doing, once the VF is running** Make Github repository public and start the website from there. 

## Nice to have

* Add Bitcount outline masters.
